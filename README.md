A simple audio spectrum visualizer made in C++.

Libraries used :
1. SFML
2. FFTW3
3. PortAudio

Currently a working version can be pulled. However, some basic installations are required :

1. Visual Studio
2. IDE (Preferably CLion)
3. CMake
4. MSVC

Configure your CLion build toolchain so that it uses MSVC to compile the program.
